# Apache Spark Example

This example demonstrates how you can write an Apache Spark job in Eta. This example was tested with Spark 2.0.2.

## Building

To build the program, execute the following in this directory:

`$ epm configure --disable-executable-dynamic`

`$ epm build`

## Running

Note: This example expects a `README.md` in the directory that the command is run, as that is the input file.

- Let `SPARK_HOME` refer to the directory which contains your `Spark` installation.
- Let `EXAMPLE_HOME` refer to the absolute path to this directory.

```
$ $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit
                  --class eta.main
                  --master local
                  $EXAMPLE_HOME/dist/build/eta-spark/eta-spark.jar
```

## Limitations
You will get runtime exceptions if you allow Spark to use multiple threads, see
[this issue](https://github.com/typelead/eta/issues/132). This is a limitation in
the current RTS that will be lifted relatively soon.
